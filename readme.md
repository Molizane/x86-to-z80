# About

Attempts to translate x86 assembly into z80 assembly.

# Why?

I want to use C++17 to futher nowind development (www.nowind.nl)
Also it is a way for me to learn what it takes to create a re-assembler for a platform where no modern compilers are available.
I think this can have very cool application in modern, small, low-cost, embedded processesors where vendors do not necessarily take the effort to maintain their own toolchain.

# Example

-- todo, once I got something, I'll add it
